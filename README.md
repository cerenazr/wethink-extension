# WeThink 🧠✨

**WeThink — think together, browse smarter**

WeThink is a tiny browser assistant built by two friends who enjoy thinking together.

It quietly reads the page you're on, understands its context, and helps you make sense of it —
summaries, key ideas, and answers to your questions.

No control.  
No interruptions.  
Just thinking together.
